# Non-Invasive Diagnostic Device for the Detection and Monitoring of Bacterial Acidogenesis on Dental Enamel
# About Us 
We are both undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire, studying Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering option. Inspired by advancements in biomedical technology, Nora from Boxford MA developed a passion for exploring innovative oral health devices. Donovan, from Derry NH, aided in the research and development of the project.
# Research Focus
Our research centers on developing a device that monitors pH levels in the mouth, addressing one of the primary causes of cavities. By utilizing Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, our device operates wirelessly and without the need for batteries, making it a groundbreaking solution in oral health diagnostics. NFC enables both power transmission and data communication, allowing for a compact, non-invasive design that integrates seamlessly with everyday life. This novel approach provides a more accessible and efficient method for early detection and prevention of dental issues, offering significant advancements in oral health care.
# Background
Early detection of cavities typically depends on visible damage or X-rays, which may not identify issues until they are advanced. Cavities form when dental enamel begins to demineralize as the pH in the mouth drops to 5.5 or lower. While saliva helps neutralize acids, it cannot effectively counteract frequent exposure to acidic foods and beverages. As a result, untreated cavities have become the most prevalent oral health issue, affecting over 2 billion people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the global population suffers from untreated oral diseases.
# Our Goals
Our goal is to create an accurate NFC pH sensor designed to adhere to a mouthguard, enabling the continuous, real-time monitoring of salivary pH levels. This device will be small, biocompatible, and ideal for seamless integration into the oral environment.
# Methodolgy
The methodology involves using an NFC transponder and a silver ink tag integrated onto a PCB. The NFC chip PCB is designed to adhere to a dental crown or tray, facilitating its placement within the oral environment. The system operates at a base resonance frequency of 13.56 MHz, with shifts in this frequency indicating changes in pH. These shifts are transmitted to a microcontroller for processing. The transmitter communicates with the microcontroller, which incorporates an SD card for data storage. The stored data is then analyzed using MATLAB, where the resonance frequency shifts are correlated to known pH levels to enable accurate pH detection.
