# Non-Invasive Diagnostic Device for the Detection and Monitoring of Bacterial Acidogenesis on Dental Enamel
# About Us 
We are both undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire, studying Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering option. Inspired by advancements in biomedical technology and the dental industry, Nora from Boxford MA developed and invented this idea. Donovan, from Derry NH, aided in the research and development of the project. Through courses at UNH, such as biomedical instrumentation, we've researched, designed, and built biomedical devices. In her personal life, Nora Kosakowski has always had a love/hate relationship with the dental world. At a young age, Nora wrestled with her teeth, through head gear, braces, and retainers. She has always valued her teeth and made it her lifetime goal to never have a cavity and she hopes to spread that message to everyone. 
# Research Focus
Our research centers on developing a device that monitors pH levels in the mouth, addressing one of the primary causes of cavities. By utilizing Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, our device operates wirelessly and without the need for batteries, making it a groundbreaking solution in oral health diagnostics. NFC enables both power transmission and data communication, allowing for a compact, non-invasive design that integrates seamlessly with everyday life. This novel approach provides a more accessible and efficient method for early detection and prevention of dental issues, offering significant advancements in oral health care.
# Background
Early detection of cavities typically depends on visible damage or X-rays, which may not identify issues until they are advanced. Cavities form when dental enamel begins to demineralize as the pH in the mouth drops to 5.5 or lower. While saliva helps neutralize acids, it cannot effectively counteract frequent exposure to acidic foods and beverages. As a result, untreated cavities have become the most prevalent oral health issue, affecting over 2 billion people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the global population suffers from untreated oral diseases.
# Our Goals
Our goal is to create an accurate NFC pH sensor designed to adhere to a mouthguard, enabling monitoring of salivary pH levels. This device will be small, biocompatible, and ideal for seamless integration into the oral environment. We see potetnial for this device to be used in tandem to your phone. Your phone will be able to tap to the deice and then tell you your mouth pH.
# Methodolgy
The methodology involves using an NFC transponder and a silver ink tag integrated onto a PCB. The NFC chip PCB is designed to adhere to a dental crown or tray, facilitating its placement within the oral environment. The system operates at a base resonance frequency of 13.56 MHz, with shifts in this frequency indicating changes in pH. These shifts are analyzed using a NanoVNA.
# Where Are We Now?
Right now, we are finishing up our senior project. More specifically, we are designing our own NFC to be smaller, allowing it to fit on at most two teeth. Additionally, we are in the second round of the Holloway Competition and are pursuing the VentureWell E-Team Program. We are then going to seek out a provisional patent as we see a lot of potentional for this concept outside of the dental field.
